 07-Sep-19: MPLM migration is an optional migration mechanism that users must use a qmp 
 command to set up migration configutation. The default mechanism is the original one. 
 After users enable mplm with this command, the original "migrate" and "savevm" operation would not work. 
 To activate them, users have to issue this qmp command  again and set the "enable" parameter to false.
